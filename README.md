# senior-proj-analysis

My senior project will explore the relationship between electoral systems and proportional representation on city councils. I will first begin analysis in my home ciy of Sacramento and seek to identify any issues with proportional representation, then conduct comparative anaylysis with diverse global cities in order to make recommendations for Sacramento.
