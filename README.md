# senior-proj-analysis

My undergraduate independent senior research project explores the relationship between electoral systems and proportional representation for women on city councils. Using my home city of Sacramento as a case study, I employ a novel data set of 201 cities in the U.S., Ireland, the Netherlands, and Australia to build a model using institutional components of electoral systems to predict proportional representation on city councils for women, with the end goal of making recommendations for improving women's representation in Sacramento. 

This repo includes the R scripts used to analyze the data and make the graphs for my final report, as well as the data used in empirical model building.
